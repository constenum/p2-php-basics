## Details for teaching team
I checked index.php using the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) and I checked styles.css using the [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/). The site was viewed on Google Chrome, Firefox, and Safari using an Apple MacBook Pro. Normalize.css was added to provide consistency between browsers.

## Outside code
